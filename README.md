Token Swap Application
This application is a simple web-based interface for a token swap smart contract. It utilizes Web3.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Setup
You will need to replace CONTRACT_ADDRESS with the address of your deployed contract and abi with the ABI of your deployed contract.

javascript
Copy code
const contractAddress = 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS'; // Replace with the deployed contract address
const abi = [...]; // ABI of the deployed contract
How to Use
The application provides a function swapTokens() that performs a token swap operation.

javascript

Copy code
async function swapTokens() {
  const amountIn = document.getElementById('amountIn').value;
  const accounts = await web3.eth.requestAccounts();

  try {
    await tokenSwapContract.methods.swap(amountIn).send({ from: accounts[0] });
    alert('Swap successful!');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error during swap:', err);
    alert('Error during swap. Check the console for more details.');
  }
}
The swapTokens() function does the following:

Reads the swap amount from an HTML element with the id 'amountIn'.
Requests access to the user's Ethereum accounts.
Calls the swap method of the contract and sends a transaction from the user's account to swap the tokens.
Alerts the user when the swap is successful or if an error occurred.
To execute a token swap, you need to trigger the swapTokens() function, which could be done through a button click event or any other event as per your application's requirement.

Error Handling
If any error occurs during the swap, it is caught and logged to the console, and an alert message is displayed to the user.

javascript
Copy code
catch (err) {
    console.error('Error during swap:', err);
    alert('Error during swap. Check the console for more details.');
}
Note
This application assumes that you are using a web3 provider like Metamask. If you are using a different setup, you might need to modify the web3 initialization.
